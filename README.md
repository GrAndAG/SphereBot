This is a fork of Eberhard Rensch's SphereBot firmware. This version has been modified to work with the Adafruit motor shield by Jin Choi <jsc@alum.mit.edu>. Some changes have been made:

* The units are changed from nominal mm to microsteps. If you are using a 200 steps/revolution stepper, G1 Y3200 will rotate the rotation axis one full turn (using 16x microstepping). This makes adjusting for object diameter unnecessary.
* The axes convention is swapped, so that the X axis is the rotation axis and the Y axis the pen axis. This was done to make it easier to adopt patterns using the Eggbot templates, which are 3200 px wide by 800 px tall.
* Pen axis values are clamped to MIN_PEN_AXIS_STEP and MAX_PEN_AXIS_STEP constants, to prevent damage from overrotation. Change these values as appropriate to your setup.
* Servo values are likewise clamped to PEN_UP_POSITION and PEN_DOWN_POSITION. These should be adjusted as necessary for your setup.
* Some g-code seems to use "M300 S255" to indicate that the servo be disabled. This is not possible without being able to control the power lines to the servo once a control signal has been sent. Any value over 180 will move the pen to the pen up position.
* Stepper control is handled by a class that implements Bresenham's line algorithm and calls to Adafruit_StepperMotor to do the steps. Maximum speed possible is about 265 steps/s, or about 30 degrees/s.

**IMPORTANT**: This sketch needs the following non-standard library (install them in the Arduino library directory):

* Adafruit Motor Shield: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Motor-Shield-library

To use:

Plug in the stepper motors and servo to the motor shield. Use M1/M2 for the pen motor, and M3/M4 for the rotation motor. M1 and M3 should have the same colored pairs of wires, as should M2 and M4, in order to have everything turn in the correct directions. The servo should go into the Servo 2 port with the brown wire towards the edge of the board. If you do things differently, edit PEN_AXIS_PORT, ROTATION_AXIS_PORT, and SERVO_PIN appropriately.

Define PEN_UP_POSITION and PEN_DOWN_POSITION appropriately. The servo gets clamped to these values, so to determine the correct values, set them to 60 and 180, then without the pen arm spring connected, send it values using "M300 Sxxx" to figure out what you should be using. Note that the servo will be driven to PEN_UP_POSITION on startup, so make sure to get that correct. The pen up position should be just high enough to clear an egg, and the pen down position low enough to firmly contact the egg, but you don't want the servo to move too much or the pen momentum can break the shell.

Set MIN_PEN_AXIS_STEP and MAX_PEN_AXIS_STEP. -480 and 480 should be fine; Eggbot patterns only use equivalent X values between -400 and 400.

I suggest using the [InkScape Unicorn Plugin](https://github.com/martymcguire/inkscape-unicorn) to generate the g-code. The maximum possible feedrate is ~265, because the servo loop will not step any faster.

A simple g-code sender script is available in Utils. It traps "M01" to allow pauses between layers.
